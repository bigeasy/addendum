## Running Addendum

Addendum is run through the `addendum` command line program. The `addendum`
command line program breaks up the many different Addendum tasks into sub
commands. When you run `addendum` with no commands, you'll be prompted to run
`addendum help` to see a list of `addendum` commands.
